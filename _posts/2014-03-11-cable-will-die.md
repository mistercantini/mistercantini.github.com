## Can't wait for the demise of cable

As I read this [article](http://qz.com/184378/the-future-of-tv-is-coming-into-focus-and-looks-pretty-great/?utm_content=buffer9e266&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer), I thought back to college and wonder why I bothered with getting a Telecommunications degree.  If you knew I work for a company that makes a sip based communications platform, you might thint that a Telecommunication degree would be of benefit.  Well, in the 90s that was Telephony and Telecommunications was radio and television production of broadcasts.  

Where is this going?   I took a class on Cable Advertising and cable was the new big thing.  *check the dates on this*  I hadn't even been on the internet yet.  For the final we had to come up with a marketing plan.  So I decided to go to the source.  I called the local cable company and asked to talk to their Sales department.  

Two days later, I had a meeting with a sales guy.  The new big idea was packaging cable channels and tiers and it would be just like how you could now get a drink, sandwich and fries for one low price.  It would be exactly the same.  

The fast-food industry now has added the $1 channel, can can't be to far from seeing some of this stuff.
