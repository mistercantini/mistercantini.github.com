### My Jekyll Journey!

#### To Blog Or Not To Blog

So once again I decided I wanted to start a blog.  So in typical fashion, instead of writing a post, I focused on what platform should I use.  I tried Tumblr, but after about an hour I realized it was not what I really wanted.  Just too many distractions and somehow I was perplexed or disappointed in the settings (can't remember which at this point.)  I've setup Wordpress sites for friends before so I thought I might go that route.  If I was going to use Wordpress though, I wanted to have it hosted somewhere.  Realizing my wife would ask me why I was spending money on a hosting site, cheap as they may be now, didn't want to have that conversation.  I have enough hobbies already that cost money.

#### The Rabbit Hole

I follow [Brett Terpstra][] and had been intrigued by reading about how he used Jekyll for his site.  If you aren't famaliar with Brett, he is a machine.  The amount of tips, tricks, and useful information he outputs is amazing.  Now I will say that everytime I read a post there is a real possibility of me running down a rabbit hole.  By that I mean I'll end up working (playing) with something, that in the end I might not even need or use.  This was going to be different this time, so I search his site for a Jekyll related post.  No luck, but that wasn't going to stop me.  

#### The Jackpot

A quick search and I found the Jekyll Bootstrap [Jekyll Bootstrap][].  Eureka!  This was exactly what I was looking for.  A blogging platform that would allow me to write in Markdown, be a little nerdy and even better, free, by hosting on GitHub.  Now having written that, Jekyll isn't a blogging platform, but I'll let their website explain what Jekyll is because I won't do it justice.

[Andrew Munsell][]: Jekyll by example tutorial
[Alex Pearce][]: Searching in Jekyll
[Development Seed][]: So some additional things that can be done, that I doubt I will get to
[David Ensinger][]: Using rake and deploying to Git.  I'm not this advanced yet, but will follow back up on this one.

And last but not least, the place I wish I would of found initially, [Jekyll][] on Github.


#### Thanks

Just wanted to give a **BIG** thank you to all these people for posting these articles to get this site up and running and maybe help someone else out.

*Cheers!*
